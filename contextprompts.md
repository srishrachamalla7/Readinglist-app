## Main App Shell & Components

```
Create the main app shell with:
- Header with search bar and add button
- Sidebar with filters (tags, status, priority, collections)
- Main content area with reading list items
- Bottom toolbar with view toggles
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Dark/light theme support
- Loading states and offline indicators
```

## Add/Edit Item Flow

```
Build an add item component that:
- Accepts URL input or manual entry
- Fetches metadata (title, description, favicon) when online
- Falls back to manual input when offline
- Includes tag picker with autocomplete
- Has priority selector (Low, Medium, High)
- Estimates reading time from content
- Shows save/cancel actions
- Handles duplicate URL detection
```

## Search & Filter System

```
Implement search and filtering with:
- Real-time search across title, description, notes, tags
- Filter buttons for tags, domains, status, priority
- Smart collections (Today, This Week, Long Reads, Quick Reads)
- Sort options (date added, priority, reading time)
- Clear all filters button
- Search history and suggestions
- Keyboard shortcuts (/ for search, ESC to clear)
```

## Tagging System

```
Create a comprehensive tagging system:
- Tag creation with color picker
- Tag autocomplete in search
- Tag management page (rename, delete, merge)
- Tag usage statistics
- Bulk tag operations
- Tag hierarchy support (optional)
- Quick tag buttons for common tags
```

## Import/Export & Backup

```
Build import/export functionality:
- JSON export of all data (items, tags, settings)
- CSV export for spreadsheet compatibility
- Import from JSON with duplicate handling
- Drag-and-drop file import
- Storage usage indicator using StorageManager API
- One-click backup to downloads folder
- Data validation on import
```

## Settings & Preferences

```
Create a settings page with:
- Theme selection (light, dark, system)
- Default priority setting
- Auto-fetch metadata toggle
- Storage usage display
- Data management (clear all, export, import)
- Privacy notice about local-only storage
- Keyboard shortcuts reference
- App version and update info
```

## Offline Handling & PWA Features

```
Implement robust offline functionality:
- Network status detection
- Graceful degradation when offline
- Offline indicator in UI
- Queue metadata fetches for when online
- Installability prompt for Windows/Android
- App shortcuts in manifest
- Push notification setup (optional)
- Background sync for metadata updates
```

## Reading Time Estimation

```
Create reading time estimation:
- Word count from fetched content or manual notes
- Average reading speed setting (default 200 WPM)
- Visual indicators for reading time (< 5min, 5-15min, 15+ min)
- Quick read vs long read categorization
- Update estimates when notes are added
```

## Performance Optimizations

```
Optimize app performance:
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Debounced search input
- Lazy loading of metadata
- IndexedDB query optimization with proper indexes
- Image lazy loading for favicons
- Bundle splitting and code splitting
- Preload critical resources
```

## Windows & Android Specific Features

```
Add platform-specific enhancements:
- Windows: File association for URLs, jump list support
- Android: Share target integration, adaptive icons
- Both: Proper viewport meta tags, touch gestures
- Native-like animations and transitions
- Proper focus management for keyboard/screen readers
- High DPI support for displays
```

## Testing & Deployment

```
Set up testing and deployment:
- Unit tests for data layer functions
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- PWA audit with Lighthouse
- Test offline functionality thoroughly
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
- Build optimization and minification
- Deploy to static host (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)
```

## Error Handling & User Experience

```
Implement comprehensive error handling:
- Network error recovery
- IndexedDB transaction error handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms for failed operations
- Loading states and skeleton screens
- Toast notifications for actions
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
